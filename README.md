# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This project explores COVID-19 data using basic to advanced SQL queries. These queries answer questions and explore trends over the course of COVID-19. Once data exploration is completed in SQL, the queries are used to create data visualizations in Tableau. My data exploration in SQL can be viewed <a href= "https://github.com/KyleGFalk/DataExplorationProject/blob/main/Covid-19%20Data%20Exploration%20Project.sql">here</a> and my dashboard in Tableau <a href= "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kyle4763/viz/CovidDashboard_16752675155180/Dashboard1">here</a>. This project was built using Big Query.

## Data Used

The dataset is from <a href= "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">Our World in Data</a>. It has data from December 2019 to March 2021. I manipulated the data in Excel to contain the columns I wanted to work with.

## Tasks

The goal of this project is to explore COVID-19 Data by performing queries in SQL. Then using those queries to create visualizations in Tableau. I explored data globally and regionally.


## Key Findings

* As of 03/01/2021, there have been 150,574,977 COVID-19 cases in the world. The current world death percentage ~2.11%, meaning there is ~2.11% chance of dying if you contract COVID-19.
